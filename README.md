Project List:  
1. RISCV DECODER: A SystemC implementation of RISCV decoder. The code is capable of parsing ELFs, And extracting RISCV opcodes
                  And sending it to the decoder simulation process. The decoder process extracts the register operands, immediates and shift amount and also
                  Detects the instuction. All these values are sent to the output, which can be later used by ALU/EX(execute) module(not created as of now)

2. MOD10_counter: A SystemC implementation of JK flip flop-based Mod-10 counter.
3. UP_counter:    A SystemC implementation of 4-bit JK flip flop-based counter.
